# cypress-basico-v2

Sample project for the course fo the Talking About Testing online school.

## Pre-requirements

It is required to have Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

> I used versions `v20.4.0` and `9.8.0` of Node.js and npm, respectively. I suggest you use the same or later versions.

## Installation

All dependencies are already on `package.json`. Run `npm install` (or `npm i` for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests
Run `npm test` (or `npm t` for the short version) to run the test in headless mode.

Or, run `npm run cy:open` to open Cypress in interactive mode.

For testing on desktop with mobile viewports just add :mobile at the end of your script. eg: `npm run cy:open:mobile` or `npm run test:mobile`
